After you install Pulp, you may want to install the Pulp CLI by following the [Pulp CLI Installation guide](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_cli/installation/).
Some plugins come with their own [cli plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_cli/#cli-plugins).

You can find Pulp CLI example workflows in the corresponding plugin documentation, where CLI commands have been implemented.

For example, you can find Pulp CLI commands for the following Pulp Python workflows in the Pulp Python docs:

* [Creating a distribution](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/pypi.html#create-a-distribution)
* [Syncing a repository](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/sync.html)
* [Creating and uploading to a repository](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/upload.html)
* [Creating and hosting a publication](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/publish.html)

For an extended list of plugin coverage, see [supported workflows](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_cli/supported_workflows/) homepage.
