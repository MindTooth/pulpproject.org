title: Pulp Installer 3.5 new roles and new deployment scenarios

There have been some big changes to Pulp Installer in 3.5.0, in terms of the role structure,
including breaking changes. Merely reading the release notes for individual changes does not paint
a complete or clear picture, hence why we are writing this blog post.

In short, we refactored the Pulp Installer roles to acheive an SOA (Service Oriented Architecture).

We now have 1 role for each service, which can each be installed to a server of its own.

This does mean that users need to update their playbooks again with a new role list.

So we created 2 new meta roles as well, to prevent users from having to change their role list
again in the future:
* `pulp_all_services`
* `pulp_services`

The refactoring benefits every user / deployment scenario we can think of, which are explained in
greater detail with example playbooks below.
* For users that want a single "all-in-one" Pulp server (including database, redis & webserver).
* For users that want to install Pulp itself on a server, but want to use existing
  infrastructure (servers) for database, redis & webserver.
* For users that want to install Pulp itself on a server, and want to install database, redis &
  webserver on separate servers.
* If a user wants to install each and every Pulp service on a different server

### "All-In-One" Pulp Server:

This is a single server, containing all Pulp services, including database, redis & webserver.

This is the new example playbook, almost identical to the one found in
pulp_installer/playbooks/example-use/playbook.yml and in the quickstart guide in the Pulp Installer
docs.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The old role list will no longer work, but instead there is 1 meta role to specify: `pulp_all_services`
* This list of 1 role name is very unlikely to change again in the future.

```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: pulp1
      vars:
        pulp_default_admin_password: << YOUR PASSWORD FOR THE PULP APPLICATION HERE >>
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: << YOUR SECRET HERE >>
          content_origin: "http://{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-container: {}
          pulp-rpm: {}
      roles:
        - pulp_all_services
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings
```

### Pulp Server with Existing Infrastructure:

This is a single server, that relies on existing database, redis & webservers.

This example playbook is almost identical to the one found in the `pulp_services` documentation.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The new role list is now 1 role: `pulp_services`.
* The role list is also unlikely to change in the future.
* `pulp_redis` (and thus a redis server) will no longer be installed on this host as a dependency of
  `pulp_workers` or pulp_resource_manager. This avoids a pointless service being installed and
  running.

```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: pulp1
      vars:
        pulp_default_admin_password: << YOUR PASSWORD FOR THE PULP APPLICATION HERE >>
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: << YOUR SECRET HERE >>
          content_origin: "http://webserver1.fqdn"
          redis_host: redis1
          redis_port: 6379
          redis_password: << YOUR REDIS PASSWORD HERE >>
          databases:
            default:
              HOST: postgres1
              ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
              NAME: pulp
              USER: pulp
              PASSWORD: << YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD HERE >>
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-container: {}
          pulp-rpm: {}
      roles:
        - pulp_services
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings
```

Note the following hostnames:
* pulp1: The Pulp server
* webserver1.fqdn : An existing webserver, specified as FQDN, and with http:// or https://
* redis1: An existing redis server.
* postgres1: An existing PostgreSQL database server

### Pulp Server + Separate Servers

Here the installer installs Pulp itself on a server, the database on a 2nd server, redis on
a 3rd server, and the webserver on a 4th server.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The new role list for the main Pulp server is now 1 meta role: `pulp_services`.
* The role list is also unlikely to change in the future.
* `pulp_redis` (and thus a redis server) will no longer be installed on the main Pulp server as a
  dependency of `pulp_workers` or `pulp_resource_manager`. This avoids a pointless service being
  installed and running on it.
* When you apply `pulp_database` to install the database server, it no longer installs the Pulp application on
  it (it no longer depends on `pulp_common`, formerly `pulp`.) This is because the functionality to
  configure the database itself is no longer in the `pulp_database` role. It is now in the
  `pulp_database_config` role, which is a dependency of `pulp_services`.
* Because of the above change, the following variables are now ignored: `pulp_install_api_service`
  and `pulp_install_db`.

Do note that the following behavior is still in place:
* `pulp_webserver` still depends on the `pulp_common` role (formerly `pulp`), so as to provide the
  per-plugin webserver snippets. So webserver1 will have pulpcore installed on it, but now pulp-api
  is no longer running & listening by default (no need to set `pulp_install_api_service=false`.)

```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: postgres1
      vars:
        pulp_settings:
          databases:
            default:
              HOST: postgres1
              NAME: pulp
              USER: pulp
              PASSWORD: << YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD HERE >>
      roles:
        - pulp_database

    - hosts: redis1
      vars:
        pulp_redis_bind: '{{ ansible_all_ipv4_addresses[0] }}:6379'
      roles:
        - pulp_redis

    - hosts: pulp1
      vars:
        pulp_default_admin_password: << YOUR PASSWORD FOR THE PULP APPLICATION HERE >>
        pulp_content_bind: 0.0.0.0:24816
        pulp_api_bind: 0.0.0.0:24817
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: << YOUR SECRET HERE >>
          content_origin: "http://webserver1.fqdn"
          redis_host: redis1
          redis_port: 6379
          databases:
            default:
              HOST: postgres1
              ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
              NAME: pulp
              USER: pulp
              PASSWORD: << YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD HERE >>
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-container: {}
          pulp-rpm: {}
      roles:
        - pulp_services
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings

    - hosts: webserver1
      vars:
        pulp_content_bind: pulp1:24816
        pulp_api_bind: pulp1:24817
      roles:
        - pulp_webserver
```

Note the following hostnames:
* pulp1: The Pulp server
* webserver1.fqdn : The new webserver, specified as FQDN, and with http:// or https://
* webserver1: The same new webserver.
* redis1: The new redis server.
* postgres1: The new PostgreSQL database server

### Separate Servers for Each & Every service

Here every single service is on its own server.

And in the example playbook, there are actually 2 worker servers.

`pulp_services` is expanded from the previous example as `pulp_api`, `pulp_content`, pulp_workers`,
`pulp_resource_manager` and  `pulp_database_config`. `pulp_database_config` is actually not a service and does depend on `pulp_common`, but it only needs to be run on one server, so we simply picked the API server.

The benefits / differences from 3.4.1 are:
* The new role list now includes 1 role per service, plus `pulp_database_config`.
* `pulp-api` is now its own role, rather than being in the `pulp` role (now called `pulp_common`) with the boolean
  `pulp_install_api_service`
* `pulp_common` is not meant to be called directly anymore.
* `pulp_redis` (and thus a redis server) will no longer be installed on the pulp_workers servers or
  pulp-res-man1 server as a dependency of `pulp_workers` or `pulp_resource_manager`. This avoids a pointless service being
  installed and running on it.
* When you apply `pulp_database` to install the database server, it no longer installs the Pulp application on
  it (it no longer depends on `pulp_common`, formerly `pulp`.) This is because the functionality to
  configure the database itself is no longer in the `pulp_database` role. It is now in the
  `pulp_database_config` role.
* Because of the above changes, the following variables are now ignored: `pulp_install_api_service`
  and `pulp_install_db`.

Do note that the following behavior is still in place:
* `pulp_webserver` still depends on the `pulp_common` role (formerly `pulp`), so as to provide the
  per-plugin webserver snippets. So webserver1 will have pulpcore installed on it, but now pulp-api
  is no longer running & listening by default (no need to set `pulp_install_api_service=false`.)
