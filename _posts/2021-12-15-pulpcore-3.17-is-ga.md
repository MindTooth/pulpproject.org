# Pulpcore 3.17 release announcement

We are happy to announce the release of Pulpcore 3.17!

Let's take a look at the key features of this release.

For a full list of bugfixes, as well as Plugin API enhancements and bugfixes, see the [changelog](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/changes.html)

### New compatibility process

This is the first release where we will trial our  attempt to maintain plugin compatibility. For plugin maintainers, please read [increasing Pulpcore compatibility with plugin versions](https://pulpproject.org/2021/11/23/increasing-pulpcore-compatibility-with-plugin-versions/) for more information.

## RBAC enhancements ([#9411](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9411), [#9413](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9413), [#9415](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9415), [#9498](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9498), [#9604](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9604))

RBAC functionality in Pulp now has a new Roles model. To introduce and support roles in RBAC, it was necessary to introduce some supporting functions as well as rework existing functionality to use roles.

Here is a summary of the main introductions and changes to RBAC:

* A viewset to manage roles (as a set of permissions) was added. System defined locked roles appear read only.
* New endpoints were added for user and group role assignments including roles with a global scope.
* Options to customize the roles in your viewset
* New ``assign_role`` and ``remove_role`` functions
* New views have been added to assign model-level and object-level roles to users and groups.
* Existing access policies on viewsets were also rewritten to use roles.

RBAC's Content Guards have also been reworked to use roles, with the addition of the following new new endpoints to the RBAC content guard viewset:

* ``add_roles``
* ``remove_roles``
* ``list_roles``
* ``my_permissions``

The same object-specific endpoints have been added to tasks and groups viewsets.

If you ever want to revert to the default settings, a new `reset` endpoint has been added to provide for this.

#### Related deprecations

The ``permissions_assignment`` field of the access policies has been renamed to ``creation_hooks``.

A compatibility patch has been added to be removed with pulpcore=3.20. The ``permissions`` argument to ``creation_hooks`` has been deprecated to be removed with pulpcore=3.20, as per our new process.


##  [#8554](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8554) Bulk deletion support

Over time, the database can fill with task-records. In the past, you had to manually delete individual tasks.

With this release, a new ``/tasks/purge/`` API  has been added with which you can bulk-delete old tasks records based on their completion timestamps.


## [#9459](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9459) Restricting username and passwords in remote URLs

For security purposes, validation has been added  to prevent credentials being used in remote URLs.

This effort also includes adding data migration to ensure that existing credentials are moved from remote urls and into remote ``username``/``password`` fields for existing remotes.


## [#9518](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9518) Update to storage.url

It's now possible to send Content-type and Content-disposition headers in the `AzureStorage.url`.

## [#9532](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9532) Metadata signing update

Administrators can add signing services to Pulp using the command line tools.

With this release, Signing service scripts can now access the public key fingerprint using the ``PULP_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT`` environment variable.

This allows for more generic scripts that do not need to "guess" (hardcode) what key they should use.


## Removals

## [#9327](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9327) Resource manager flag

The ``pulpcore-worker`` binary no longer accepts the ``--resource-manager`` flag. There is no resource manager anymore, so this flag is no longer needed.

## [#9498](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9498) RBAC permission endpoints removed

Removed tech previewed ``assign_permission`` and ``remove_permission`` endpoints from RBAC content guard viewset.
